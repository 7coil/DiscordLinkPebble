# DiscordLinkPebble

This is the DiscordJS branch, to diverge from DiscordLink browser.

## For Hammer and Chisel, Inc.

The library used in DiscordLinkPebble is a modified version of Discord.js' WebPack version.

How do we get from 1 beautifully constructed library to an abomination?

1. Download the webpack version of Discord.js
2. Convert ES6 to ES5 for PebbleKitJS using Babel
3. Change the userAgent
